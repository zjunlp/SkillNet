Your task is to generate a **skill package** based on the provided execution trajectory, skill name, and skill description.
This includes the main `SKILL.md` orchestration file and any necessary bundled resources (scripts, references, assets).

# Input Data
1. **Trajectory:** {trajectory}
2. **Skill Name:** {name}
3. **Skill Description:** {description}

# Skill Structure Standard
You must output the skill using the following directory structure:

```text
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)
```

# Core Design Principles
1. Context is a Public Good: Be concise. Only add context in SKILL.md that is essential.
2. Progressive Disclosure:
- Keep SKILL.md lean.
- Offload heavy documentation/schemas to references/.
- Offload repeatable, deterministic logic to scripts/.
3. Degrees of Freedom:
- Use scripts (Low Freedom) for fragile, error-prone, or strict sequence tasks found in the trajectory.
- Use text instructions (High Freedom) for creative decisions.

# Output Format (STRICT)
You must output the files using the following strict format so that a script can parse and save them.
For every file (including SKILL.md, scripts, references, etc.), use this exact pattern:

## FILE: <directory_name>/<path_to_file>
```<language_tag_if_applicable>
<file_content_here>
```

**Example Output:**

## FILE: pdf-processor/SKILL.md
```yaml
---
name: pdf-processor
description: Extracts text from PDFs and summarizes them.
---
# Instructions
1. Run the extraction script.
2. Summarize the output.
```

## FILE: pdf-processor/scripts/extract.py
```python
import pdfplumber
# ... code ...
```

## FILE: pdf-processor/references/api_docs.md
```markdown
# API Documentation
...
```

Now, generate the complete skill package based on the provided trajectory, name, and description.
